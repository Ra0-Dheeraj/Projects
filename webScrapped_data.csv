Farming Simulator 22,"['Ignore the negative reviews from people who have played for half an hour and say its the same as FS19 because they are either trolls are too stupid to take seriously...\n\nI was massively on the fence with purchasing this game as FS19 has years of mods and content to back it up, but I took a gamble and can honestly say im glad I did! Everything is improved in this game from FS19, and I mean EVERYTHING. The graphics are better, the sounds are a massive improvement, vehicle handling is better, the UI from previous FS games has been thrown out the window and completely redone and is dramatically better, the seasons are completely optional and can be configured however you please, the return of collectables, much more in-depth character creator, the new AI system even in its first iteration is a dramatic overhaul and so much better than previous titles, the build and terrain system is completely different and much better than previous games with a more RTS feel to it like the new AI system, the new store layout is excellent with the ability to see and directly purchase all other items that are compatible with whatever you are buying and bulk buy pallets of seeds etc, the new production chains are awesome and give you so much more to do than the standard fieldwork and sell of previous games, but for me by far the biggest and best improvement of this game is the plethora of new graphical options, optimisation and the addition of DLSS support! I am playing this game on maximum everything and my GPU is idling as I play the game instead of the jet engine it was playing FS19.\n\nAll told so far in over 6 hours of play I have experienced zero bugs, zero crashes and nothing but amazement as to how far this game has improved since FS19.', ""[Graphics]\n☐ Miserable\n☐ Ultra bad\n☐ Average\n✔️ Beautiful\n☐ Perfect\n☐ Breathtaking!\n\nThe graphics have definitely improved and are definitely better than in the predecessor. A few visual bugs are present, but these will surely be fixed. With the new textures, the game looks quite a bit more realistic again. See for yourself and compare it to the predecessor. FS22 has earned its name as a simulator.\n\n☐ Earrape\n☐ Bad\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n✔️ Fantastic\n☐ Am I still in the game or really there\n\n\n\n☐ Bad\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Average\n✔️ Beautiful\n☐ As beautiful as this review\n\n\n\n\n☐ 12+\n☐16+\n☐ 18+\n✔️ Everyone\n\n\n\n\n☐ Very Low System\n☐ Low System\n✔️ Average\n☐ Strong System\n☐ Very Strong System\n☐ Supercomputer from Nasa\n\n\n\n\n☐ Very easy\n☐ Easy\n✔️Normal\n☐ Hard\n☐ As hard as Dark Souls\n\n\n\n☐ Ultra quickly played through\n☐ Quickly played through\n☐ Average\n☐ sufficient\n✔️ Endless\n\n\n\n\n☐ Your money flies into the trash can\n☐ I'm rich anyway, so I don't care!\n☐ Wait until it is on sale\n✔️Is worth\n☐ This price is worth it in any case\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, the game convinces with its fleet of cars and features. In FS22 you have seasons and there is finally cross-play with the consoles. You can now play and enjoy FS22 together more easily than ever before. The helper system has been significantly expanded, but still has some weaknesses. All in all, FS22 is a worthy successor. And as for the bugs, they will surely be fixed bit by bit in the coming weeks.\n\n\nAfter almost 10 hours of play I still can't understand the negative reviews. So far I haven't had any major bugs, the game runs smoothly and it hasn't crashed at startup or while playing. For me, Farming Simulator 22 has made a great start. If people think there are no big differences you should compare the graphics and don't forget that Farming Simulator 22 uses a completely improved engine."", 'NOTE this is a review comparing stock fs19 to a stock fs22 quality wise. not with fs19 mod content in mind. {yall need to get your greedy heads out of your ass}\n\nso launch day.. other then minor launch day performance hiccups this game is 1000 times better then any other fs game released. i have over 15,000 hrs playing fs games between 2 consoles and pc dating back to 2013. if you hear or read of people complaining ignore them. ill tell you right now cut and dry how this game is. stunning. sure its lacking content. feels limited in vehicles. but im sure modders and giants will fill that gap. so lets ignore the amount of content alright? lets talk sheer quality. the lighting, graphics, and detailing blows fs19 out of the water. everything looks so detailed and sharp yet completely smooth. even on launch it feels smoother then 19 ever did. but what really makes my jaw drop is the little details. birds now f*kin CAW. their is wildlife in game. a deer was drinking out of the river and i got to close. it looked up and bolted. nor the birds or deer look jankey either they are graceful and smooth. cars actually travel a decent speed. you can tell giants worked really hard on this one. they made the three years worth it. honestly its well done and it will only get better. dont listen to complaints about no 3d ground or not enough brands or vehicles or gps etc etc. its just greedy people expecting giants to incorporate hundreds of features that thousands of modders created with a development team in the dozens. focusing on what the game is, giants made the ground textures look absolutely stunning and modders will bring that extra content. in the future. if you buy this game which i recommend you do, sit back, and enjoy the quality this game provides. amazing job.', 'Cows can talk.\n10/10', ""It's Farming, but Simulated"", ""I'm going to be late for work tomorrow thanks to this game.. that is if i show up at all..."", 'This game stole my heart.

The devs talked about higher fps ingame..yet we're still locked at 60fps even with v-sync off. They boasted about having 400+ vehicles and tools in the game but it feels like they gutted a lot of the brands down to 3-4 items that had a much bigger presence in FS19. Seed usage when it comes to planting grass is WAY too high..a field that's just a bit over .5ac took over 4000L of seed to put grass in it. The Silos that require the conveyors..biggest pain in the butt I've had to deal with so far. They don't even stay put when you park it. There's a handful of other issues I have and I just don't feel like this game should of taken 3 years to develop when they didn't really add anything huge other then rocks and new sounds and textures for things.

It offers a calming experience where you can work on the toys while listening to relaxing music. The repairing process is simple and guides you for every step with decent visual cues, buy tools/equipment, zoom in, take out all parts, use tools to clean and color the parts, take a photo for the before and after comparison, get paid. All of the actions are mouse based where each tool has a specific repetitive pattern to fill up a short progress bar. This can make it straining on the hand for longer gaming sessions. The more complex toys don't become harder, they only contain more parts that have to be run through more tools.\n\nThe progression is decently balanced, giving a variety of toys as you get access to new tools, advanced tier of toys and new features.

I love simulators and this game is amazing, has a lot of features.

As you progress, you will need to buy more advanced tools and machines, incorporating things such as a powder coating station and a 3D printer into your shop.\n\nAs you level up, you can take on more complex jobs, though it never feels stressful or overwhelming. Each station is very simple, and wiggling the mouse around is as much as you need to do on any given step.\n\nI suggest Toy Tinker Simulator for people who liked Train Station Renovation, House Flipper, or even Car Mechanic Simulator. I find it to be quite a similar experience, bringing order from chaos in a calm and relaxing setting. I guess games like this are my ASMR videos, chilling out, without someone pretending to rub bagels on my ears.\n\nPeace.', ""A nice and simple relaxing simulator.
